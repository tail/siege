.SH NAME
.B siege.config
\- builds a .siegerc template in the user's home directory.
.SH INTRODUCTION
.LP
With the release of version 2.00, siege supports a settings configuration file to permanently store runtime variables.  The settings in this file are the default values for every siege invocation. They are superceded by command line options, so if the configuration file has a default "times = 10" and the user invokes siege with \-t1000, then siege will run 1000 times and not 10.
.LP
When siege is installed on a system, a .siegerc file is installed in the installing user's home directory.  This means that only the user who installed siege has a configuration file.  The siege.config utility was designed to install a .siegerc file in the home directory of the user who invoked it. This makes it possible to have customized siege configuration on a per user basis.
.SH INVOCATION
.LP
The format for invoking siege.config is this:\fR
.br
siege.config [no arguments]\fR
